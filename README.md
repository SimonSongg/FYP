Inherited from the Autonomous Delivery Vehicle project, I used three UWB anchors and one UWB tag to achieve indoor localization. Meanwhile, thanks to TensorRT, I accelerated the inference speed of the collision space segmentation model used in the previous project to 3x. Moreover, I built an app using swift to enable the remote control between an iPhone and the vehicle through Bluetooth.
